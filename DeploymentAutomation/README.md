# Deployment Automation

There was a time when I was in a shop that did all software deploys manually.  There were a lot of applications and a lot of steps that had to be performed manually.  Needless to say, human error reared its head on almost every single deploy.  I decided to put an end to the madness by writing scripts that handled the process, making it repeatable and documenting what we actually did for each deploy.  We eventually rolled out Octopus to deploy our appplications but these scripts served us well until that was in place.

job-deploy.ps1
---------------
This script handles deploying mission critical console applications (jobs) that are run from Windows Task Scheduler.  Jobs were run 24/7 on various schedules so we had to be careful about deploying binaries or ending tasks when a particular job was running.  This script will end a task or wait for it to complete, disable the task, copy the new binaries, and then ren-enable the task.

staging-deploy.ps1
---------------
This script will take an IIS site name and a build path and perform the steps nessesary to deploy an application.  If a test url is supplied by the user the script tests the site and displays an ASCII squirrel if a 200 is response is returned.  I used to call this from master script on each server for every site that was getting deployed.  It outputs a nice log file so that the entire deployment process is documented.

production-deploy.ps1
---------------
We maintained a staging site and a prod site on each IIS server.  After deploying to staging and verifying the application I would call this script to swap the existing prod and staging paths in the IIS configuration.  We marked the prod and staging paths in the file system with a file called zz_PRODUCTION.txt or zz_STAGING.txt (not my invention) so that admins would know which files were being served in each site when browing the file system.  This script handles placement of those files in the correct order.  Notice the use of the plagerized ASCII squirrel when the site responds with a 200.
